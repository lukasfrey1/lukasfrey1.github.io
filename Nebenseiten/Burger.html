                <main>
                    <h4>📝Ingredients</h4>
               <div> <ul>
                    <li>2 pounds 80/20 ground beef, cold</li>
                    <li>4 cloves minced garlic</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons minced onion</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
                    <li>1 3/4 teaspoons freshly ground pepper</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
                    <li>6 hamburger buns</li>
                    <li>Butter for buns</li>
                    </div>
                     </ul>

                   <div> <h4>👨‍🍳Cooking Instructions</h4>
                    <p>1 Make the burger mix: Put the cold ground beef in mixing bowl. Sprinkle the other ingredients evenly over top. Fold the meat over a few times to get everything incorporated. This entire process should only take about 30 to 45 seconds. Don’t over handle the meat.
                        <br>
                        2 Shape the burger patties: Rather than forming the patties in your hand, form them on a tray. This makes it easier to shape the patties without over-handling or warming the meat. I like to use a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper, but any tray or platter will do.
                        <br>
                        3 Heat the grill: Heat a gas or charcoal grill to 450 to 500°F, or hot enough that you can only hold your hand above the grill grates for about 1 second.
                    Butter the insides of all the buns and set them near the grill.
                        <br>
                        4 Grill the burgers: Place patties on the grill over direct heat. Cook to your desired doneness:
                    For rare burgers, cook for 4 minutes total (125°F)
                    For medium-rare burgers, cook for 5 minutes total (135°F)
                    For medium burgers, cook for 6 to 7 minutes total (145°F)
                    For well-done burgers, cook for 8 to 9 minutes total (160°F)
                    Flip the burgers at least once during cooking, or as often as you wish. Do not press down on the patties at any time.
                    <br>
                    5 Add the cheese and toast the buns: When you have about 1 minute left on the cooking time, add the cheese to the burgers and the buttered buns to the grill over indirect heat.
                    <br>
                    Rest the burgers: Remove burgers and buns from grill and transfer to a clean platter. Let the burgers rest for 1 minute before serving.
                    <br>
                    7 Serve: Serve with tomato jam, mayonnaise, bacon jam, garlic aioli, blue cheese sauce, sautéed mushrooms, Thousand Island, or the classic and always wonderful lettuce, tomato, pickles and red onion.
